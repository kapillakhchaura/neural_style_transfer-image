Neural Style Transfer - Task 3 (AI Internship at CodTech)

Objective
The goal of this project is to implement a Neural Style Transfer model that applies artistic styles from paintings to real-world photographs. This combines the content of one image with the style of another to produce a stylized output.

Project Overview
This project was created as part of Task 3 for the CodTech Artificial Intelligence Internship. It demonstrates the use of deep learning techniques to transform the style of an image while preserving its content.

The model uses a pre-trained convolutional neural network (such as VGG19) to extract features and blend the style and content effectively.



Technologies Used
Python 3.7+
TensorFlow / PyTorch (based on your implementation)
NumPy
OpenCV
Matplotlib

Output Example
The program takes two images:
A content image (e.g., a photo)
A style image (e.g., a painting)

It produces a new image that reflects the content of the first and the style of the second.
